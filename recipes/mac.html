        <h2>Mac and Cheese</h2>
        <p>This classic baked mac and cheese recipe with a buttered bread crumb topping is creamy and comforting. <br>
            It's easy to make the cheese sauce from scratch on your stovetop,<br> starting with a roux and adding milk, 
            Cheddar, and Parmesan, resulting in a rich, decadent sauce that coats every nook and cranny of the noodles.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Macaroni:</strong> This homemade mac and cheese starts with a box of uncooked macaroni noodles.</li>
            <li><strong>Butter and flour:</strong> You'll need butter and flour to make a roux for the cheese sauce. You'll also need two tablespoons of butter for the topping.</li>
            <li><strong>Milk:</strong> Use whole milk for the richest flavor and texture.</li>
            <li> <strong>Cheese:</strong> This baked mac and cheese recipe calls for Cheddar and Parmesan cheeses.</li>
            <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> Salt and pepper goes into the sauce, while paprika is sprinkled over the topping.</li>
            <li><strong>Bread crumbs:</strong> Use store-bought dried bread crumbs or make your own at home.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Boil the noodles:</strong> Boil the macaroni in salted water until the noodles are al dente. Drain and transfer to a prepared baking dish.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the cheese sauce:</strong> Melt butter, then whisk in the flour. Whisk in the milk, bring to a simmer, and stir in the cheeses. Season with salt and pepper and continue simmering until the sauce is thick. Pour the sauce over the noodles and stir.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the topping:</strong> Melt two tablespoons of butter in a skillet, add the bread crumbs, and toast until the crumbs are brown. Spread the topping over the macaroni and cheese, then sprinkle with paprika.</li>
